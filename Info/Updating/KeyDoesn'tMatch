READ IF: You tried to upload an update for the app and Google Play Console says that your key does not match the previous one

1. Do you have the Java Keystore file?! It should be called WestviewAppKeystore.jks
  a. You can check in Android Studio. Build > Generate Signed APK... And check the Keystore path. If that path does not exist on
     your computer, then you most likely do not have the keystore. If you do have the keystore, just change it to the correct path
     and you're done.
     
2. If you do not have the Keystore file, contact that previous developer and ask them if they can send you their keystore file.
   If you cannot contact the prev. dev. and/or for some reason cannot get the Keystore file, continue.

3. Go to https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/contact/otherbugs

4. Make sure you are signed in as westviewdeveloperwics@gmail.com

5. Fill in the fields accordingly
  a. First name: Westview
  b. Last name: WICS
  c. Email: westviewdeveloperwics@gmail.com
  d. Dev. name: Westview WICS
  e. CHECK Need help with issue
  f. CHECK Keystore related
  g. CHECK I lost my key
  h. Feedback/description: We no longer have access to the original keystore and thus cannot update our app (Or something along
     those lines)

6. Wait for about 2-3 business days for an email from Google Play Dev Support (to westviewdeveloperwics@gmail.com)
  a. They will tell you how to generate a keystore and how to get the pem certificate
  b. They will also tell you to attach the certificate and reply to their email

READ IF: You've never worked with Java Keystore/Keytool before!!!!
NOTE: The following instructions are for Windows only

1. Run Command Prompt as Administrator

2. Type the following line-by-line into the cmd prompt window
  a. cd \..
  b. cd Program Files\Java
  c. cd jdk1.8.0_151\bin
    - IF the above command does not work, you may have a different version of Java. Just go into your file explorer and go to
      C:\Program Files\Java  and look for the jdk file (it should look the same as the one in part c but with different numbers)
    - THEN type the name of that file instead of the one in part c
  d. keytool -genkeypair -alias upload -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 9125 -keystore WestviewAppKeystore.jks
  e. Use the westviewdeveloperwics@gmail.com password for the keystore
  f. (Answer the questions)
  g. Use the same password
  h. keytool -export -rfc -alias upload -file upload_certicate.pem -keystore WestviewAppKeystore.jks
  i. Enter password
  
3. Attach file: upload_certificate.pem (found in C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_151\bin) to email and reply

4. When generating the signed APK remember to change the keystore path to the correct one
