Here's a list of possible errors that we've run into while updating on Play Store, and how to fix them! Feel free to add on as needed.

1. Keystore File or any other Key error: see KeyDoesn'tMatch file under Updating folder

2. Target Version needs to be updated: Under build.gradle (Module: app), change targetSdkVersion to whatever version PlayStore needs it to be.

3. A version code for this # already exists: under build.gradle (Module: app), change versionCode to +1 of the previous one (ex: 4 to 5, 11 to 12)
